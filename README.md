# Shex
A simple and very uneffiecient language written in Python. Based on: https://github.com/davidcallanan/py-myopl-code

Examples can be found in the `Examples` folder. I'm currently splitting it into multiple files, so it's easier to read. But that may take some time lmao. Feel free to fork it.
